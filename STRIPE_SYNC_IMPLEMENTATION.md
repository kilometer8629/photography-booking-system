## Summary of Changes

Fixed the booking details modal to properly display Stripe payment status synchronization with direct links to payment transactions.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Status Display Enhancement

**Location**: `public/js/admin.js` - Line ~1190

**What Changed**:
- Status badge now checks `depositPaid` flag first
- Shows "Confirmed (Payment Received) ‚úì" when payment received
- Falls back to booking status field only if no payment

```javascript
// Now displays
Status: Confirmed (Payment Received) ‚úì    (when depositPaid = true)
```

### 2. Payment Transaction Link Added

**Location**: `public/js/admin.js` - Line ~1212

**What Added**:
```javascript
${booking.stripePaymentIntentId ? `
<div class="modal-row">
    <span class="modal-label">Payment Transaction:</span>
    <span><a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments/${booking.stripePaymentIntentId}" 
             target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
             title="View payment transaction details">View Transaction</a></span>
</div>
` : ''}
```

**Result**: Admin can now click directly to view the customer's actual payment details in Stripe dashboard

### 3. Refresh Button Handler

**Location**: `public/js/admin.js` - Line ~1295

**What Added**: 
- Refresh button in modal footer
- Fetches latest booking data from server
- Closes modal and shows updated data
- User sees real-time status updates

### 4. Enhanced Modal Footer Logic

**Location**: `public/js/admin.js` - Line ~1235

**What Changed**:
- Footer buttons now based on `effectiveStatus` (payment status)
- If payment received, shows "Confirmed" state
- Appropriate buttons for each state

## How It Works Now

### When Payment is Completed

1. Customer pays via Stripe checkout
2. Stripe sends webhook to server
3. Server updates booking: `depositPaid = true`, `status = 'confirmed'`
4. Admin opens booking details
5. Modal displays:
   - ‚úÖ Status: **Confirmed (Payment Received) ‚úì**
   - ‚úÖ Payment Status: **Paid ‚úì**
   - ‚úÖ Paid At: **[Timestamp]**
   - ‚úÖ View Session link
   - ‚úÖ View Transaction link (NEW!)
6. Admin can click "View Transaction" to see payment details in Stripe

## Stripe Links Explained

### What is a Stripe Session?
- Created when customer clicks "Book & Pay"
- Redirects customer to Stripe checkout form
- Contains booking details and amount
- **Link**: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/sessions/{sessionId}`
- **Shows**: Checkout flow, customer info, amount, status

### What is a Payment Intent?
- Created by Stripe when payment is processed
- Contains actual card details, fees, settlement info
- The real transaction/order
- **Link**: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments/{paymentIntentId}`
- **Shows**: Payment method, amount, fees, charges, customer

### Why Both Links?
- **Session**: For understanding checkout experience
- **Payment**: For payment verification, refunds, disputes

## Technical Details

### Database Fields Used

```javascript
booking {
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'cancelled' | 'completed',
  depositPaid: boolean,
  stripePaidAt: Date,
  stripeSessionId: string,           // Links to checkout session
  stripePaymentIntentId: string      // Links to payment transaction
}
```

### Webhook Handler Updates

When `checkout.session.completed` event received:

```javascript
booking.status = 'confirmed';
booking.depositPaid = true;
booking.stripePaymentIntentId = session.payment_intent;  // ‚Üê Gets payment intent ID
booking.stripePaidAt = new Date();
```

### API Endpoints

- **Fetch Booking**: `GET /api/admin/bookings/{id}`
  - Returns full booking with all Stripe fields
  - Includes `stripePaymentIntentId` for transaction link

- **Webhook**: `POST /api/webhooks/stripe`
  - Receives payment confirmation
  - Updates booking with payment details
