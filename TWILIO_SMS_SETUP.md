# Twilio SMS Notification Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up Twilio SMS notifications for customer appointment reminders and updates in the Photography Booking System.

## Overview

The system uses Twilio to send SMS notifications to customers for:
- **Booking Confirmation**: When a new booking is created
- **Payment Confirmation**: When payment is successfully processed
- **Reschedule Notification**: When a reschedule request is submitted
- **Cancellation Notification**: When a booking is cancelled with refund information
- **Booking Reminders**: (Optional) Automated reminders before appointments

## Prerequisites

- A Twilio account ([Sign up here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio))
- A Twilio phone number capable of sending SMS

## Setup Instructions

### 3. Get Your Twilio Credentials

1. From the Twilio Console Dashboard, locate:
   - **Account SID** (starts with "AC...")
   - **Auth Token** (click to reveal)
2. Keep these credentials secure - you'll need them for configuration

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following variables to your `.env` file (or `.env.production` for production):

```bash
# === Twilio SMS Configuration ===
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+61412345678
```

**Important Notes:**

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control

### 5. For Vercel Deployment

## Testing SMS Functionality

### During Development

1. Use the Twilio trial account with verified phone numbers
2. Add test phone numbers in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/verified)
3. SMS will only be sent to verified numbers during trial

### Testing Process

1. Create a test booking through the application
2. Check the server logs for SMS status:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Initial booking SMS sent to +61412345678
   ```
3. Verify the SMS was received on the customer's phone
4. Check the Twilio Console ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Logs for delivery status

## Troubleshooting

### SMS Not Sending

**Check 1: Environment Variables**
```bash
# Verify variables are set
echo $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
echo $TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
echo $TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
```

**Check 2: Server Logs**
Look for warning messages:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Twilio credentials not configured. SMS notifications are disabled.
‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to send booking confirmation SMS: [error message]
```

**Check 3: Phone Number Format**
- Must be in E.164 format: `+[country code][number]`
- Examples:
  - ‚úÖ `+61412345678` (Australia)
  - ‚úÖ `+14155552671` (USA)
  - ‚ùå `0412345678` (missing country code)
  - ‚ùå `61412345678` (missing +)

**Check 4: Twilio Account Status**
- Verify your Twilio trial account is active
- Check you haven't exceeded your trial credit
- Ensure the recipient's number is verified (for trial accounts)

### Common Errors

**Error: "Invalid phone number"**
- Ensure the phone number is in E.164 format
- Check the country code is correct

**Error: "Authentication failed"**
- Verify your Account SID and Auth Token are correct
- Ensure no extra spaces in environment variables

**Error: "Insufficient funds"**
- Trial credit has been used up
- Upgrade to a paid Twilio account

## Cost Estimation

### Twilio Pricing (as of 2024)

- **SMS to Australia**: ~$0.076 USD per message
- **SMS to USA**: ~$0.0079 USD per message
- **Trial Account**: $15 USD credit (approximately 190 messages to Australia)

### Monthly Cost Estimation

For a photography business with:
- 50 bookings per month
- Each booking receives 2 SMS (confirmation + payment)
- Total: 100 SMS/month √ó $0.076 = ~$7.60 USD/month

## Disabling SMS Notifications

If you want to disable SMS notifications (e.g., during development):

1. **Option 1**: Remove the Twilio environment variables
2. **Option 2**: Comment out the SMS sending code in `server/index.js`
3. **Option 3**: Set the variables to empty strings

The application will continue to work without SMS - it will just skip sending messages and log a warning.

## Phone Number Formatting

The system automatically formats phone numbers to E.164 format:

- `0412345678` ‚Üí `+61412345678`
- `04 1234 5678` ‚Üí `+61412345678`
- `(04) 1234-5678` ‚Üí `+61412345678`
- `+61412345678` ‚Üí `+61412345678` (no change)

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Messages Concise**: SMS has a 160-character limit for single messages
2. **Include Business Name**: Always identify your business in the message
3. **Provide Value**: Include essential information (date, time, location)
4. **Respect Opt-Out**: Honor customer requests to stop SMS notifications
5. **Monitor Costs**: Keep track of your Twilio usage and costs
6. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test with real phone numbers before going live

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ Store Twilio credentials in environment variables, never in code
- ‚úÖ Use `.env` files and add them to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Rotate your Auth Token periodically
- ‚úÖ Monitor Twilio logs for suspicious activity
- ‚úÖ Set up usage alerts in the Twilio Console
