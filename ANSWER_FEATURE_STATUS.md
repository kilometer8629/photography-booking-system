## 🎓 How It Works

### Technical Flow

1. **Customer completes payment** via Stripe
2. **Stripe webhook triggers** payment confirmation
3. **Server updates booking** in database to "confirmed"
4. **Email sent** with tax receipt
5. **SMS sent** with payment confirmation ← **NEW!**
6. **Admin sees** confirmed booking in dashboard
7. **Admin confirms** booking (if needed)
8. **Another SMS sent** with booking confirmation ← **NEW!**

### Phone Number Handling

The system automatically formats phone numbers:
- `0412345678` → `+61412345678` (Australian)
- `5551234567` → `+15551234567` (US)
- `(04) 1234 5678` → `+61412345678` (with spaces/parentheses)

No manual formatting needed!
