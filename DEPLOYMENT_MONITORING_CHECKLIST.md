### Problem: Build Failed

**Solution:**

- Check Vercel build logs
- Look for image processing errors
- Revert commit if necessary: `git revert 88ec4b9 && git push`

### Problem: Some Images Missing

**Solution:**

- Check for 404 errors in Network tab
- Verify filename references in HTML
- Check public/images/ directory exists
- Restore from backup if needed

### Problem: Performance Not Improved

**Solution:**

- Wait 30-60 minutes for CDN cache
- Test in new incognito window
