## 🔧 WHAT NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED

### Environment Variables Setup

The Twilio SMS feature is **code-complete** but requires environment configuration:

#### Step 1: Create `.env` File
Create a file named `.env` in the project root (if not already present).

#### Step 2: Add Twilio Credentials
```bash
# Twilio SMS Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

#### Step 3: Get Credentials from Twilio
1. **Sign up** at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com) (if you haven't already)
2. **Get Account SID & Auth Token** from [Twilio Console Dashboard](https://console.twilio.com/)
3. **Purchase a phone number** from [Phone Numbers section](https://console.twilio.com/phone-numbers/incoming)
   - Must be in E.164 format (e.g., `+61412345678` for Australia)

#### Step 4: Test the Implementation
```bash
# Start the server
npm start

# In another terminal, if testing locally with Stripe
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Create a test booking with a valid phone number
# Complete payment flow
# Check if SMS is received
```
