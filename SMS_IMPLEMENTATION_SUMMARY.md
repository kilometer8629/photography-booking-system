# Twilio SMS Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive Twilio SMS notification system for your photography booking system. This allows you to send SMS messages to customers directly from the admin panel.

## Key Features

### 1. SMS Management Section in Admin Panel
- New "SMS Messages" tab in the admin navigation
- View all sent SMS messages with filtering options
- Track delivery status (sent, failed, delivered, pending)
- Send SMS button with modal form

### 2. Send SMS from Bookings
- "Send SMS" button on confirmed bookings
- Customer details auto-populated
- Quick access to send notifications

### 3. Message Templates
Six pre-built templates for common scenarios:
- **Appointment Reminder** - Remind customers of upcoming sessions
- **Booking Confirmation** - Confirm new bookings
- **Running Late** - Notify of delays (with delay time field)
- **Rescheduled** - Notify of date/time changes (with new date/time fields)
- **Cancelled** - Notify of cancellations
- **Custom Message** - Write any custom message

### 4. Phone Number Formatting
Automatically handles Australian phone numbers:
- Accepts: `0412345678`, `+61412345678`, `04 1234 5678`
- Converts to E.164 format: `+61412345678`
- Also supports international numbers with country codes

### 5. SMS Tracking
- Complete history of all sent messages
- Links to associated bookings
- Delivery status monitoring
- Error tracking for failed messages

## Setup Required (By You)

### Step 1: Create Twilio Account
1. Go to https://www.twilio.com
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email and phone number
4. Get a trial phone number (or purchase one for production)

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials
From your Twilio Console Dashboard:
- **Account SID** - Found on main dashboard
- **Auth Token** - Click "Show" to reveal
- **Phone Number** - Your Twilio number (e.g., +61412345678)

### Step 3: Add to Environment Variables

**For Vercel Deployment:**
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Add these three variables:
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = your_account_sid_here
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = your_auth_token_here
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = +61412345678
   ```
4. Redeploy your application

**For Local Development:**
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+61412345678
```

### Step 4: Restart & Test
1. Restart your application (or redeploy on Vercel)
2. Log into admin panel
3. Go to "SMS Messages" section
4. Click "Send SMS" to test
5. Send a test message to your own phone

## Important Notes

### Trial Account Limitations
- **Can only send to verified numbers** - You must verify phone numbers in Twilio Console before sending
- **Trial message prefix** - Messages include "Sent from your Twilio trial account"
- **Limited daily messages** - Usually around 20-50 messages per day
- **Upgrade to remove limits** - Consider upgrading for production use

### Costs (After Trial)
- SMS to Australia: ~$0.08 AUD per message
- Phone number rental: ~$1.50 AUD per month
- Pricing varies by destination country

### Compliance & Best Practices
- Get customer consent before sending marketing messages
- Include opt-out option (e.g., "Reply STOP to unsubscribe")
