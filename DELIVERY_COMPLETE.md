### 2. Three API Endpoints
**File:** `server/index.js` (lines ~738-854)

**Endpoint 1: GET /api/customer/booking**
```javascript
// Find customer booking by email
GET /api/customer/booking?email=john@example.com

Returns:
{
  "_id": "68fe5d1af1e666f30ef42e77",
  "clientName": "John Doe",
  "eventDate": "2025-11-15T14:00:00.000Z",
  "startTime": "14:00",
  "location": "Seattle, WA",
  "package": "Santa's Gift Pack",
  "packageAmount": 50000,
  "status": "confirmed"
}
```

**Endpoint 2: POST /api/customer/reschedule**
```javascript
// Submit reschedule request
POST /api/customer/reschedule
{
  "bookingId": "68fe5d1af1e666f30ef42e77",
  "newDate": "2025-12-01",
  "newTime": "10:00",
  "reason": "Conflict with another event"
}

Result:
- Booking status → "pending_reschedule"
- Email sent immediately
- Admin reviews within 24 hours
```

**Endpoint 3: POST /api/customer/cancel**
```javascript
// Cancel booking with auto-refund
POST /api/customer/cancel
{
  "bookingId": "68fe5d1af1e666f30ef42e77"
}

Result:
- Refund calculated based on days to event
- Booking status → "cancelled"
- Cancellation email sent with refund amount
- Refund processed in 5-7 business days
```

### 3. Smart Refund System
**Logic:** Automatic calculation based on event date
```
IF days_until_event >= 21:
  refund_percentage = 90%  # Full minus 10% admin fee
ELIF days_until_event >= 8:
  refund_percentage = 50%
ELSE:
  refund_percentage = 0%   # Non-refundable
```

**Example:**
- Booking: $500
- Cancel 25 days before: Get $450 back (90%)
- Cancel 15 days before: Get $250 back (50%)
- Cancel 5 days before: Get $0 back (0%)

### 4. Email Templates (2 new)
**File:** `server/index.js` (functions at bottom)

**Email 1: Reschedule Confirmation**
- Subject: "Reschedule Request Received - Ami Photography"
- Shows: Current booking, requested date/time, reason
- HTML formatted with brand colors
- Assures price and package remain same
- Says: "We'll confirm within 24 hours"

**Email 2: Cancellation Confirmation**
